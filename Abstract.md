In the past year I have been working with the net culture initiative servus.at to develop a program that brings together artists and researchers to engage with the contemporary field of machine learning and question our relationship with—and through—computers.
I review my own and the collective practices we developed through digital and analog programs and contextualize them into the broader field of artificial intelligence and art. I chose to focus on three commonly used technological techniques: data aggregation, voice recognition and synthesis, and stochastic text generation, because together they uncover many tropes of what we think of AI today and why we are inspired by it. 
The aim of this thesis is to counter the narrative of artificial intelligence as singular agents and argue for the emergence of co-intelligence. I belief that through protocols and coding languages we collectively build systems that do more than an individual alone and while the connections within software systems are often hidden from sight, they can easily be revealed by looking for their human contributions.
In my individual work I have tried to address some of the issues that arise, like the exploitation of public image data, but more importantly with the organization of the Silicon Friend Camp and the Conversations with Computers symposium, we have created a network of connected artistic works that deal with the contemporary condition of seemingly smart devices.
