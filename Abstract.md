Can you rewrite this text to be an abstract for my Master thesis:
In the past year I have been working with the net culture initiative servus.at to develop a program that brings together artists and researchers to engage with the contemporary field of machine learning and question our relationship with—and through—computers.
I review my own and the collective practices we developed through digital and analog programs and contextualize them into the broader field of artificial intelligence and art. I chose to focus on three commonly used technological advancements: data aggregation, voice recognition and synthesis, and stochastic text generation, because together they uncover many tropes of what we think of AI today, their ethical issues and why we are inspired by it. 
The aim of this thesis is to counter the narrative of artificial intelligence as singular agents and argue for the emergence of co-intelligence. Through protocols and coding languages we collectively build systems that are more than the individuals alone and while the connections within software systems are often hidden from sight, they can easily be revealed by looking for their human contributions.
In my individual work I have tried to address some of the issues that arise in the field, like the exploitation of public data, but more importantly with the organization of the Silicon Friend Camp and the Conversations with Computers symposium, we have created a network of connected artistic works that deal with the contemporary condition of seemingly smart computers in new and exciting ways.

This thesis explores modes of communication with (and through) computers, focusing on the development of a program that brought together artists and researchers to question our relationship with computers. It reviews individual and collective practices developed through digital and analog forms, contextualizing them within the broader field of ‘artificial intelligence’ and art. The thesis focuses on three technological advancements: voice recognition and synthesis, data aggregation, and stochastic text generation, to uncover ethical issues such as the exploitation of public data. All inspire a counter-narrative of co-intelligence
