## Introduction 
Computers are everywhere. They are part of our entertainment, work, education, household, health, life and death. We communicate with computers every day. Looking back on the history of our species it can be said that we are an intelligent species. We are capable of planning ahead, using tools, creating meta-tools and using these meta-tools to create even more meta-tools. We are capable of playing, exploring, creating, building, destroying, fighting, loving, dreaming and getting lost. The question that I am trying to answer in this thesis is, are we capable of communicating with computers? Is it possible to build a bridge between us and our silicon companions? 
## Thesis 
The thesis consists of three parts. Each of them deals with a different layer of our communication with computers. The first part deals with the tool layer. It is about the technical devices we use to communicate with computers. I show how I am using hardware and software to communicate with my computer. I am using my computer to play the game of Go, I am making it dance and I am giving it light. The second part deals with the interface layer. It is about the visual and audio languages we use to communicate with computers. I am using my computer to create sounds, to visualize my life and to create abstract art. The third part deals with the input layer. It is about the languages we use to communicate with computers. I am using my computer to tell jokes, to understand human emotions and to learn new languages.
