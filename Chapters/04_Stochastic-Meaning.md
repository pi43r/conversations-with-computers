# Stochastic Meaning

## Attention is all you need

Context:
Understanding language is an essential aspect for computer assistants to be truly useful. However, language is a challenging area since words can have various meanings depending on the context. Furthermore, there are multiple languages and different ways of converting spoken language into written symbols.
Using computers for the task of natural language processing (NLP) is as old of a research subject since computers existed. 
Task: Expand here on the ELIZA, “conceptual ontologies” and other symbolic NLP methods
Your turn:

One of the earliest examples of symbolic natural language processing is ELIZA, a computer program developed in the 1960s that simulated a conversation between a patient and a therapist. ELIZA used pattern matching and substitution to generate responses based on the user's input, giving the impression of understanding what was being said. While ELIZA was limited in its capabilities, it paved the way for more sophisticated NLP techniques.

Another approach to NLP is through the use of conceptual ontologies, which are structured representations of knowledge in a particular domain. These ontologies can be used to help computers understand natural language by mapping words and phrases to their corresponding concepts in the ontology. For example, if someone says "I want to buy a red car," an ontology could map "red" and "car" to their corresponding concepts and infer that the person is interested in purchasing a vehicle with a specific color.

Symbolic NLP methods also include techniques such as parsing, semantic analysis, and machine translation. Parsing involves breaking down sentences into their constituent parts (such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives) and analyzing how they relate to each other syntactically. Semantic analysis goes further by attempting to understand the meaning behind words and phrases based on their context. Machine translation uses these techniques to automatically translate text from one language into another.

While symbolic NLP methods have been successful in some applications (such as chatbots and question-answering systems), they have limitations when it comes to handling ambiguity and understanding human emotions or nuances in language. As a result, more recent approaches to NLP have focused on machine learning techniques that allow computers to learn from large amounts of data without relying on pre-defined rules or ontologies.
