# Contributions

Thank you to my supervisors *Manuela Naveau*, *Christa Sommerer*, *Laurent Mignonneau*, and Fabricio Lamoncha.

A special thanks to *Davide Bevilacqua* and the *Servus.at* association for making the *Silicon Friend Camp*, exhibition, and symposium possible.

Thank you to *Bani Budassin* who invited me to write for Temes des Disseny, which formed my thoughts around Dataset Art. 

And, of course, to all my new and old friends, contemporaries, and collaborators.
I am because you are.
