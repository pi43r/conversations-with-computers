Thank you to my supervisors *Manuela Naveau*, *Christa Sommerer* and *Laurent Mignonneau*.
A special thanks to *Davide Bevilacqua* and the *Servus.at* association for helping me realize the Silicon Friend Camp, exhibition and symposium.

Thank you to *Bani Budassin* who invited me to write for Temes des Disseny which formed my thoughts around Dataset Art. 

And of course to all my new and old friends, my fellow contemporaries.
I am because you are.
