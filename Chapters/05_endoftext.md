## Termination

I started this journey by making new friends through a shared interest in computers. Trying to understand what “artificial intelligence” means, where it came from and what this ideology envisions for our future with computer systems. I was intrigued by the sci-fi idea of virtual assistants and artificial pets that communicate with us through a common voice interface. However, as I delved deeper into the subject, I discovered a vast difference in how human language evolved and how computers are designed to analyze piles of data. This data scraping process is enabled by the internet and has its own politics, raising questions about consent and what it actually is that these new AI systems are conditioned on. Ultimately, I circled back to analyze the architecture of generative text models and how they create meaningful output. Only to realize that ‘intelligent’ machines are merely an illusion that we willingly embrace because we have learned to connect with other humans who speak our language. Computers are not magical devices but merely designed to perform magic tricks.

In the beginning I hoped to uncover the human contributions that go into building AI systems. From the ingenious invention of electrical computers and coding languages, to the people creating, labeling and sorting data into manageable parts, to the people using these devices to connect with other people. I thought we can see AI systems in a different light. Rather than buying into the illusion of sentient machines, we can see these tools as the artifacts of human creativity, maybe even cherish them for the collaborative effort that makes them possible. However, I came to believe that exactly this obfuscation of human labor is intentional and necessary for the development and marketing of AI systems.

The myth of the self-sufficient AI system, capable of learning and improving on its own, is a powerful marketing tool. It promises a future where machines will make our lives easier and more efficient, without requiring any human input or intervention. This vision of AI as a fully autonomous entity not only ignores the fact that humans are still integral to its development, but also obscures the potential consequences of this technology.

As AI systems continue to be integrated into our daily lives, it's important to recognize that they are not neutral or objective tools. They are built by humans who bring their own biases, values, and perspectives into the process. The data that is used to train these systems is also collected by humans who make choices about what data to include or exclude.

Furthermore, the use of AI systems can perpetuate existing societal inequalities if those biases are not addressed. For example, facial recognition technology has been found to have higher error rates for people with darker skin tones, which can lead to discrimination in areas such as law enforcement and hiring practices.

In conclusion, recognizing the human labor that goes into creating AI systems is important in understanding their limitations and potential risks. We must be critical of the narratives surrounding AI that promote a myth of self-sufficiency and instead acknowledge the role humans play in both its development and impact on society.

Initially, my aim was to explore the role of humans in the development of AI systems. This included the creation of electrical computers and coding languages, as well as the individuals responsible for organizing data into digestible segments and utilizing these devices to facilitate communication. By viewing AI systems through this lens, we can appreciate them as a product of human ingenuity rather than subscribing to the notion of sentient machines. In essence, we can value them for the collaborative effort that brought them into existence.
