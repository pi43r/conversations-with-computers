> Ubuntu: I am, because you are[^1]



---
[^1]: The term Ubuntu originates from southern Africa and is used to describe a humanist philosophy according to which persons are interconnected. It is often used in phrases such as the Zulu ‘Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu’, which translates to  ‘A person is a person through other persons’. The term for personhood (ubuntu) itself is not clearly defined and has different meanings in different areas. @gadeWhatUbuntuDifferent2012
