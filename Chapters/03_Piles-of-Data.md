# Piles of Data

The idea behind Artificial Neural Networks has a long standing history. Using our understanding of the brain as a blueprint for mathematical operations dates back to the 1950s when the psychologist Frank Rosenblatt developed the *Perceptron*.[^1] Inspired by nerve cells and their connections (synapses), the perceptron takes multiple input values, sums them up and outputs a 0 or 1 depending if a predefined threshold is reached. With an apparatus that turns light to black and white ‘bits’ (today we would say pixels) the Perceptron could ‘sense’ shapes in the form a binary matrix. Using positive and negative reinforcement to define the weights for each connection it was possible for Rosenblatt to build a detector that can distinguish between circles and squares. He proposed that a network of perceptrons could possibly recognize faces and objects. Frank Rosenblatt never got to see his invention take off.[^2] Another engineer, Kunihiko Fukushima, kept refining his methods by adding multiple layers, effectively creating the first ‘deep neural network’ where deep just means the depth of ‘hidden layers’ connecting the input signal to the output. He called these self-organizing systems Cognitrons[^3] which were successful at accurately recognizing numbers and letters on a 12x12 grid. It’s successor the Neocognitron[^4] took further inspiration from the visual cortex and a discovery by Hubel & Wiesel in the 1950s and 60s that some neurons selectively respond to local features like lines and edges and others to figures like circles and squares or even human faces.

[^2]: Frank Rosenblatt died in a boating accident in 1971. A couple years prior Marvin Minsky heavily criticized the mathematics behind perceptrons and advocated for a symbolic approach. These turn of events might have lead to a lack of funding in the ‘connectionist’ AI research field and ultimately lead to a general disinterest when the symbolic approach could not keep their promises.
