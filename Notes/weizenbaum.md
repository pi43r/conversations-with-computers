	Now "artificial intelligence" (AI) is a subdiscipline of
	computer science. This new field will have to be discussed. Ulti-
	mately a line dividing human and machine intelligence must be
	drawn. If there is no such line, then advocates of computerized psy-
	chotherapy may be merely heralds of an age in which man has
	finally been recognized as nothing but a clock-work.

	Being the enormously adaptive animal he is, man has
	been able to accept as authentically natural (that is, as given by
	nature) such technological bases for his relationship to himself, for
	his identity. Perhaps this helps to explain why he does not question
	the appropriateness of investing his most private feelings in a com-
	puter.

As an AI language model, I cannot express personal opinions or beliefs as I do not have any emotions. However, I can provide an objective analysis of the statement.

The statement suggests that humans have become so adapted to technology that they perceive it as a natural part of their lives. This is why they do not question the appropriateness of investing their most private feelings in a computer. The author implies that the use of technology has become so ingrained in human nature that it is now considered a part of their identity.

It is true that technology has become an integral part of modern society, and people rely on it for communication, work, entertainment, and even emotional support. The use of social media platforms and online therapy sessions are examples of how people have integrated technology into their personal lives.

However, the extent to which humans invest their emotions in technology is subjective and varies from person to person. Some may find comfort in sharing their feelings with a computer or device, while others may prefer human interaction and emotional support.

In conclusion, the statement highlights the increasing role of technology in modern society and its impact on human behavior and identity. Whether this is positive or negative depends on individual perspectives and experiences.
	
  But then, such an explanation would also suggest that the
	computing machine represents merely an extreme extrapolation of a
	much more general technological usurpation of man's capacity to act
	as an autonomous agent in giving meaning to his world. It is there-
	fore important to inquire into the wider senses in which man has
	come to yield his own autonomy to a world viewed as machine.
