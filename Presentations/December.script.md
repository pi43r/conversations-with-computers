# Conversations With Computers
---

In the past year I have been working with the net culture initiative servus.at to develop a program that brings together artists and researchers to engage with the contemporary field of machine learning and question our relationship with (and through) computers.
This thesis is both, an insight into collaborative meaning making of digital tools in the early 21st century and a contextualization of my own artistic practice in the field of AI.
The aim of this thesis is to counter the idea of artificial intelligence as singular agents and argue for the emergence of collective intelligence. Through protocols and coding languages programmers (in the past also known as computers) collectively build systems that solve tasks more efficiently than the individual being. And exactly this ideology of efficiency is questioned by the artists, coders and theorists in this thesis.
How do we envision new forms of conversation in a networked society? How can we subvert oppressive tools of automation and categorization?
