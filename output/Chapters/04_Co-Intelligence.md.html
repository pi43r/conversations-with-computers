<pre><code>Ubuntu: I am, because you are</code></pre>
<p><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The cognitive scientist Abeba Birhane takes the South African humanist philosophy of <em>Ubuntu</em> as an argument against a western tradition of the <em>self</em> as autonomous beings.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> According to <em>Ubuntu</em> philosophy a person becomes a person, only through the relationships with others. The personality is shaped by the interactions with each other and is fluidly shifting between different states. I am a different person, when talking to my mother, my friends and strangers on the street. At the same time, my upbringing and cultural influences define my own self-image. Birhane traces back the flaws in western theories of the mind to René Descartes ‘cogito ergo sum’ – I think, therefore I am. In his famous meditation the French philosopher tried to strip back all things of uncertainty to arrive at the foundation of inner thoughts as proof of existence. In turn this individualistic ‘I’ and the method of logical reasoning have become a successful story in western sciences. First, cartesian dualism, the idea of a separate mind and body and secondly the scientific method of breaking down complex natural phenomenons into simplified quantifiable parts. For more than 200 years scientists, philosophers and theologists stood in front of the ‘body-mind problem,’ coming up with theories of how the immaterial ‘soul’ interacts with the fleshy human body: Why are we conscious of the world around us, ourselves and others?</p>
<p>We concluded that the brain must do the thinking<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> and using the scientific method the brain was separated into smaller parts until synapses and neurons were defined and described. But the physical functioning of the brain does not explain the emotional experience of the self. The groundwork was done by the mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who proposed the existence of fundamental ‘monads’ that transcend all matter in the universe, which function as an intermediary between mind and matter. Sir John Eccles applied this theory to the model of synaptic actions that he developed through experimentation with electricity and the brain, he called the mysterious forces through which we control the brain ‘psychons.’ But neither psychons nor monads served as a sufficient explanation for the bridge between mind and matter.</p>
<p>Dualism continues to have a major impact on the way we think about Artificial Intelligence and consciousness. For example, the influential cyberneticists Norbert Wiener and Claude Shannon both based their work on the assumption that information is a separate entity from matter and energy. This assumption has led to a disembodiment of information, and a false separation of the physical world (the “hardware”) from the world of ideas (the “software”).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Following a materialist logic, consciousness becomes information embedded in the physical substrate of the brain. If we could only measure all physical activities, we can simply duplicate and simulate the experience of being human. The metaphor of the brain as a computer defines our present and justifies predictions of ‘downloading’ consciousness and achieving digital immortality. It culminates in the popular ‘simulation hypothesis’ that proposes we already live in a simulated environment.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Computational neuroscientists use and develop instruments to quantify electric impulses in the brain and create massive amounts of experimental data, which in turn need statistical models and ever growing computing power to be analyzed. On the other spectrum, simplified models of the brain in the form of artificial ‘neural networks’ are used to compute and sort higher order abstractions. This focus on the individual brain in the search to replicate intelligence leaves aside a physical and social environment, in which conscious beings are embodied.</p>
<p>In order to understand human cognition and intelligence, we need to explore the dialogic connections between human and non-human actors. Current machine learning programs abstract intelligence into simplified task solving mechanisms and make us believe that the underlying algorithm becomes a rational agent. But on a closer look the program reveals an astonishing amount of human collaboration: from the creation of programming languages, digital computing and ultimately the internet to the enormous amounts of data aggregation and labeling. Instead of looking at AI systems and seeing them as a subjective entity, we can also see them as artifacts of collective intelligence.</p>
<h2 id="silicon-friend-camp"><strong>Silicon Friend Camp</strong></h2>
<p>The Silicon Friend Camp was a 5-day working retreat in Gosau, Upper Austria, for artists and researchers working on Artificial Intelligence. The summer camp was organized by servus.at with funding from LINZimPULS. Together with the curator Davide Bevilacqua, we started to develop the program in summer 2020. The artist Rosi Grillmair joined as facilitator and program supervisor in early 2021.</p>
<p>Due to changing pandemic conditions, a vacation home in the mountains was rented so that, despite close contact between participants, the risk of infection from the outside could be kept to a minimum. So instead of holding the program as a hackathon in the city in spring, it was moved to the summer and took place from July 20th to July 25th.</p>
<p>To create a selection of artists, we published an Open Call that was distributed as a website, designed by Alyona Ciobanu, on mailing lists and social media. Inspired by a previous call for a residency at Babycastles<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>, we decided to create a form that does not ask for CVs or portfolios, but focuses on a project idea and what kind of knowledge the participant is seeking from others and is able to share. To our delight 31 artists from Europe, North and South America responded to the call, of which 12 were selected by the jury. The artists were chosen with a view to diversity of their projects, origin and gender. Among others, people from China, Japan, USA, Brazil, Colombia, Russia, Germany, Poland and Slovenia should come together in Austria. The planned projects ranged from remote-controlled robots, to philosophical debates, to music pieces with embodied AI.</p>
<p>But before we physically met in Gosau, an internet forum<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> was set up for participants to introduce themselves and initiate discussions and suggestions on content. The forum also served to communicate organizational behaviors in an easily accessible and quick manner. We also held two video conferences in which Rosi read a story on narratives of AI that served as a basis for discussion.</p>
<p>Through the forum and video conferencing, we also maintained contact with a participant from Colombia who joined us from the Andes mountains during the project week.</p>
<p>Our preparation for the schedule of the physical work session involved the participants by asking them to contribute discussions, workshops and presentations. But also gave them enough flexibility to decide on individual and group projects.</p>
<p>The first day got off to a leisurely start with 10 participants: arriving at the train station throughout the day and being picked up and brought to the house. Together we slowly cleaned the garage, attic and living room. All while a dinner was prepared by Hess Jeon, who took care of the food for the next 5 days. We set up a table in the garden and used the time to introduce the project and welcome everyone. Before dinner, I generated a daily meal prayer with GPT-3 that was recited by us together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eating is a sacred, human right <br> But food is getting scarce <br> There are humans who are hungry <br> And there are humans who are fat <br> We must ask ourselves, <br> Who are the humans? <br> I am the human <br> You are the human <br> We are the human <br> Because I am the human, <br> You are the human <br> We are the human <br> Because you are the human, <br> I am the human <br> Because we are the human, <br> You are the human <br> Because I am the human</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The morning of the second day was used for a group meeting in which we established general rules and defined the goals of the camp together. The participants presented their projects and what they would like to achieve in the next days.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the time could be used independently. While some sank into their laptops, others explored the surroundings around the house. We built up an area-wide network and cleared the attic and the garage so that they could be used as working places.</p>
<p>Towards the evening, a daily <em>Group Validation</em> took place, in which the participants individually summarized what they had done today, what they planned to do next and what they needed help with.</p>
<p>After dinner, time was spent together in the attic, where carpets, mattresses, speakers and a projector were installed as a <em>Digital Campfire</em>. On the first evening we were engaged in storytelling around anthropomorphic beings. In between, EKHEO played live electronic music.</p>
<p>Day 3 began without electricity. This was especially tragic because we had a video call scheduled with researcher and artist Caroline Sinders.</p>
<p>With some delay we got reception back to the internet and could follow Caroline’s talk about the impact, misuse and politics of “artificial intelligence” on society. This was followed by a discussion on how models of machine learning can be looked at through a feminist lens.</p>
<p>After lunch, there was a meeting where we reviewed the schedule to plan workshops and ventures for the next few days. The rest of the day was self-organized.</p>
<p>In front of the <em>digital campfire</em> Dasha Ilina presented her work dealing with inconveniences of technological devices. Also, Naoto Hieda showed improvised choreographies created with dance and live code.</p>
<p>On the morning of Day 4, three texts were presented for discussion in a reading circle before dinner. The texts dealt with self-representations in global networks, intelligence without cognition, and root networks as a metaphor for the mind.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Since this was the last full day to finish our projects, the day was used intensively. Many sat in front of their laptops working, for example, on a film they had previously made or trying out AI systems, such as VoiceCloning and generative image models, with which to realize their visions.</p>
<p>The digital campfire in the attic also got intense in the evening: after an introduction to artificial neural networks by Błażej Kotowski, Giacomo Piazzi gave a presentation on Thinking Beings. Mariana Marangoni spoke about esoteric programming languages that challenge accepted definitions of code and language. Lastly, Davide Bevilacqua gave a presentation highlighting Green Washing methods used by well-known Internet companies.</p>
<p>The last day together was used in the morning to prepare final presentations, which were shown after lunch. Dasha Ilina, Erica Jewell and Lina Schwarzenberg presented <em>GRAVE</em> a video in the form of a Public Service Announcement to prepare access to digital devices and services for posterity. Naoto Hieda and So Kanno explained a work in which they rebuilt a toy robot and made it controllable via the Internet. EKHEO performed a piece for which they developed synthetic voices from all participants. Błażej Kotowski showed a video about a fictional deity in which text and images were generated using machine learning algorithms. Yuxi Liu explained how she used a camera to create a dataset of birds. Mariana Marangoni thought about a programming language that could be built like a tree.</p>
<p>We spent the rest of the afternoon at a mountain lake, where we got caught in a storm, which, at least for me, was the most terrifying experience I ever encountered. But after drying up in the house and eating freshly baked pizzas, the rest of the evening turned into a dance party. Still Maks Valenčič gave another lecture on <em>The End of Philosophy</em> with a soundtrack by Błażej. Sebastián Mira also joined us from Colombia and showed us a digital world in which he connected the Andes with the Alps. Finally I used GPT-3 again to print texts for Certificates of Excellence that were handed out in a ceremony.</p>
